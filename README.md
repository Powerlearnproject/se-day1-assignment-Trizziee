#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
  Software engineering is the usage of engineering principles, methods, and tools to create and keep up high-quality software       systems. It includes the design, development, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance of software products.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  1.The development of programming languages like Fortran and C
  2.The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
  3.The advent of structured programming in the 1970s 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  Requirements- This is the gathering and documenting the needs of the user the system requirements.
  Design- This is the creation of high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
  Implementation- This is Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
  Testing- This is conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
  Deployment- This is releasing the software to users or customers.
  Maintenance- This is providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  The waterfall methodology is  the sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downwards like a waterfallwhile the agile      methodology is the iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
  The waterfall methodology is not very flexible due to its rigid structure. It is best suited for projects where requirements      are well-understood, stable, and unlikely to change while the agile methodology is very flexible, allowing for frequent           adjustments based on client feedback, market changes, or new discoveries during development.
  
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  1. Software developer- He/she is responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  2. Quality assurance engineer- He/she is responsible for ensuring the software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  3. Project manager- He/she is responsible in overseeing the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and       testing code. some examples are, Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
  Version Control Systems (VCS) are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.    Some examples are Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
  Changing Requirements- Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
  Tight Deadlines- Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
  Technical Debt- Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and          increase maintenance costs.
  Strategies for Overcoming Challenges- Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, agile                 methodologies, prioritization of tasks, and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software.
  Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
  System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole.
  Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
  Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
  Vague propmt: Recomend a recipe for em to cook
  Clear prompt: Recomend an easy african traditional recipe for me to cook for five people
  The improved prompt is more effective because I have guided the AI in what kind of answer I want therefore that is what I will get.
